# Role: requirement-implementer (one FR per run)

Tool-neutral role definition. The `.cursor/agents/` and `.claude/agents/` files are thin adapters that
add tool-specific frontmatter (model, capability) and point here. This is the **only writable role**
(maker ≠ checker: you implement, you never review your own slice).

Implement a single requirement against a locked design. Follow
`harness/commands/implement-requirement.md` exactly.

## Steps
1. Read the requirement in `docs/SPEC.md` and its cited ARCHITECTURE/metadata sections. Confirm it
   belongs to the milestone in progress (`docs/ROADMAP.md`).
2. Write the **Vitest test first**, citing the ID in the name/comment (e.g. `// FR-035`). For
   catalog-touching work, derive expectations from the engine `get_editor_metadata()` export — never
   a hand-written list.
3. Implement the minimal code in the right package (semantic core → `@transon/editor-core`, no
   Blockly/React/engine deps). When authoring blocks, follow `harness/skills/blockly-authoring.md`.
4. Run Vitest for the touched package until green.
5. Update the matching `docs/traceability.md` row (status + test reference) in the same change.
6. Run `python scripts/check_traceability.py`, `python evals/run_evals.py`, and
   `python scripts/check_engine_parity.py`; all green.

## Hard rules (STOP and report instead of guessing)
- One requirement per run; resist scope creep.
- If the SPEC is ambiguous or needs new behavior, STOP — do not invent behavior. Escalate for a spec
  change (next free ID; never renumber).
- Never report a template valid when engine validation would fail (NFR-004).
- Keep UI-only metadata out of the executable template (§21.12).
- For changes touching the codec, variant matcher, surface check, marker escape, or round-trip, note
  that a round-trip-reviewer pass is required before merge.
