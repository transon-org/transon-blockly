# harness/ — the tool-neutral harness core

`harness/` holds the **entire tool-agnostic harness** in one place. `.cursor/` and `.claude/` are thin
adapters at the repo root (each tool mandates its own root dir); `.github/` is the CI (GitHub mandates
the root). Everything else lives here. The full cross-tool map is
[`docs/portability.md`](../docs/portability.md).

- `agents/` — subagent role bodies (milestone-planner · requirement-implementer · round-trip-reviewer)
- `commands/` — command procedures (run-milestone · implement-requirement)
- `skills/` — skill procedures (transon-authoring · blockly-authoring · round-trip-review · spec-traceability)
- `workflows/` — workflow procedures (`review-gate` — adversarial pre-merge review)
- `scripts/` — deterministic gates (`check_traceability` · `check_engine_parity` · `check_presentation` · `check_no_codec_mapping` · `check_behavior_runtime_size` · `check_maturity` · `check_links` · `update_memory`)
- `evals/` — harness golden-path evals (`run_evals.py` + model-judged `cases/`)
- `githooks/` — binding git hooks (`pre-commit` · `commit-msg`); enable with `git config core.hooksPath harness/githooks`
- `automations/` — **outer-loop, propose-only** watchers (`drift_watch` · `ci_triage` · `worktrees.md`); the
  scheduled half lives in `.github/workflows/drift-watch.yml`. **Harness-core, not adapters** → exempt
  from rule 2's "both tools" requirement (explicit exclusion; see `docs/portability.md`)

## Harness governance (the rules for changing the harness)

These **harden the harness, not the product** — harness changes need *no SPEC change*; product behavior
still goes SPEC-first (§21.2). Ratified in the maturity work (M-03 / M-07 / M-16):

1. **Single source.** A command / skill / agent-role *body* lives once, here in `harness/`. `.cursor/`
   and `.claude/` carry only tool-specific frontmatter + "read the `harness/` body and follow it" — they
   reference the core, **never each other**. Don't copy a body into a tool; copying re-creates the drift
   the harness exists to prevent.
2. **Both tools, equally.** Any new command / skill / subagent / hook lands in `harness/` **and both**
   `.cursor/` and `.claude/` adapters — or carries an **explicit, documented exclusion** (record it in
   `docs/portability.md`). Cursor and Claude Code are first-class peers, in operation *and* in assessment.
3. **Gated, not hoped.** `harness/evals/run_evals.py` (cross-tool parity) and `harness/scripts/check_maturity.py --check`
   (maturity ratchet — tool-symmetric) bind in the pre-commit hook and CI. A red gate is a STOP: fix it,
   never weaken or bypass it.
4. **Docs split by role.** `AGENTS.md` + `harness/` + the adapters *operate*; `docs/portability.md` and
   the guides under `docs/guides/` *describe and track* — they reference the operating contract, never
   restate it.
