## Last action

_**M1 codec de-risk built + green; round-trip-reviewer review in progress, commit pending.** Branch
`m1-codec-skeleton`. (0) **Engine re-pin to v0.1.3** committed (`197d034`) — the M1 prerequisite (`type`
fn + `include` `IncludeContext` loader); cascaded `v0.1.1`→`v0.1.3` doc refs. (1) **T0 adapter fix**
committed (`bb9c0d9`): the v0.1.3 `include` loader is `loader(name, context=…)` → must build via
`context.transformer(…)` (self-`include` recursion + depth guard); added the `EngineProvider.transform`
`includes` bundle channel + fixed `collectIncludes`. (2) **The codec is built + tested but NOT yet
committed** (staged in the working tree): `packages/editor-core/src/codec/` = `codegen.ts` (the `@`-staged
`G_encode`/`G_decode` arms projected from `attr` metadata + fixed skeleton + `generateCodec`/`serializeArtifact`),
`run.ts` (engine-free encode/decode via the host port, `CODEC_MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH=25`), `vocabulary.ts`
(block types + `WorkspaceBlock`/`JsonPathBlockMap`), committed `artifacts/{encoder,decoder}.json`;
codec tests live in `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/` (round-trip structural+execution, encode,
decode, workspace-shape, ceiling, regen) + `harness/scripts/check_no_codec_mapping.py` (FR-126). The
**de-risk is proven**: `decode(encode(T)) == T` structurally AND by execution (AC-035) over the M1
corpus; per-rule arms are projected from metadata (AD-026) with **byte-equal regen** (AD-030);
out-of-surface → `transon_unsupported`; deep nesting fails cleanly with a `CodecError` (§6.5 — found +
fixed a real raw-stack-overflow via the `maxIncludeDepth` cap). **Independent `round-trip-reviewer`
found 2 must-fix correctness bugs — both fixed + independently re-verified (sign-off: round-trip sound,
safe to merge for the M1 prototype scope):** (#1) presence was decided
by comparing a param's VALUE to a sentinel, so a valid `attr` whose `default` equalled the sentinel
string was silently dropped (AC-035/AD-004 break); (#2) variant matching only checked required-present
+ first-match, so ambiguous (`name`+`names`) / foreign-param `attr` nodes were silently rewritten
instead of → `transon_unsupported`. **Fix:** presence is now KEY-based (the codec `set`s the node,
compares key NAMES against generation-time-known param names; no value sentinel — `ABSENT` deleted),
and variant matching is EXACT (all required present AND no foreign key → else the cond default →
unsupported); decode `decInput` is key-based too. Also hardened the FR-126 scan (bracket/destructuring
access) and fixed a dead regex in `isRuleBlockType`. Regression coverage added (sentinel-default,
ambiguous, foreign). **107 tests pass**; typecheck + build + all gates green (parity 4 fns, traceability,
no-codec-mapping + selftest, snapshot-drift, maturity 93%, evals). Traceability rows + ROADMAP M1
tracker (☐→◐) updated. **Key codec mechanics learned** (load-bearing):
`map`/`filter` iterate `this` (not a `value` source — chain into `this` first); `set` stores `this` (no
`value` param); `include` passes only `this` (navigate via `chain` before recursing); `switch.cases`
must be a literal mapping (merge fixed+generated cases at codegen time, not via runtime `join`); `join`
merges dicts; `object key+value` builds a single dynamic-key dict; `object/fields` omits NO_CONTENT
values (drives optional-param omission); **presence/membership must be KEY-based** (a value-sentinel
collides — review #1) and the engine `!`/`not` operator does NOT negate (use `!=` / restructure).
Reviewer signed off (maker≠checker). **Next:** finish the remaining M1 scope — T5 literal-marker escape
(FR-123), T6 full surface check (§15.7), T7 `JsonPathBlockMap` (FR-091/094/122) — then M2 (fold the full
catalog by extending `generateCodec`'s rule list + the `G_*` arms; no skeleton change, AC-034).
(Prior: RFC-002 absorption + coherence fixes committed `b3e6669`/`cb5b738`; M0 editor build `8751707`.)_

### Prior last action (M0)

_**M0 editor-side build landed** on branch `m0-editor-scaffolding` (uncommitted, in the working tree).
Scaffolded the pnpm/Turborepo monorepo with the AD-021 pins (Node ≥20, pnpm 10.27.0, TS 5.9.3, Vite
6.4.3, Vitest 2.1.9, Turbo 2.10.0, Changesets 2.31.0); stubbed `@transon/editor-core` (deliverable #1)
with the `EngineProvider` port + §9.9/§9.10 result types and a typed `metadata-snapshot.json` loader;
built the test-only Node→Python `transon` adapter (`test/engine-node-adapter`, AD-011/AD-025) — a
long-lived subprocess speaking newline-JSON to `runner.py` — and the `@`/`$` two-pass staging proof
(FR-116/FR-119/AD-027/AD-030). All gates green: typecheck, `pnpm -r test` (13/13), build,
`check_traceability.py`, `check_engine_parity.py` (22 rules/28 ops/3 fns). Engine pin resolved: local
`../transon/.venv` is at `0.1.2` but its metadata export is identical to the pinned `5812b63`, so parity
holds — no checkout/re-pin. **Independent `round-trip-reviewer` sign-off complete**: the staging proof,
no-`eval` discipline, adapter↔engine fidelity, and the FIFO subprocess protocol were all verified
correct via counterfactual tests; the one must-fix — a hardcoded `DEFAULT_VENV_PYTHON` absolute path —
is fixed (the adapter now resolves `<transonRepo>/.venv/bin/python`, proven by the suite passing with
`TRANSON_PYTHON` unset); a stale doc comment in `snapshot.ts` was also corrected. Gates re-run green.
Traceability rows for AD-008/AD-011/AD-027·FR-116/FR-119·AD-030/NFR-047 stay `[~]` on purpose — those
IDs are only *partially* covered by M0 and complete across M1/M2/M4. **M0 editor-side slice committed
as `8751707` on `m0-editor-scaffolding` (not pushed); ROADMAP M0 tracker flipped to ☑.** Deferred
follow-up: add a request-id to the bridge protocol (currently safe, see M1)._

## Status by milestone

The authoritative milestone tracker is [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md#milestone-tracker); this is the
living read of it.

- **M0 — engine `switch`/`cond` + projection-ready export + Node adapter** — ☑ done (committed
  `8751707`, not pushed; CI pin flip deferred). Engine half: `../transon` exports
  `get_editor_metadata()` (`switch`/`cond` + projection-ready split catalog/docs, `metadata_version
  2.0`) — captured in [`metadata-snapshot.json`](metadata-snapshot.json). Editor half: monorepo
  scaffolding + AD-021 pins, `@transon/editor-core` stub (`EngineProvider` port + snapshot loader), and
  the Node→Python `test/engine-node-adapter` running markers `@`/`$` — reviewed + gate-green. Only the
  CI engine-pin flip (M-09: `--require-engine`) remains, waiting on `transon` being pip-installable in CI.
- **M1 — `editor-core` codec skeleton + `G_encode`/`G_decode` for `attr`** — ◐ in progress (de-risk
  proven; round-trip + DoD gates green; review pending; not yet committed). Codec lives in
  `packages/editor-core/src/codec/`; engine-executed tests in `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/`.
  `decode(encode(T)) == T` structurally + by execution over the M1 corpus (AC-035); arms projected from
  metadata with byte-equal regen (AD-026/030); workspace-shape + FR-126 gates pass; clean recursion
  ceiling (§6.5). **Remaining M1 scope:** literal-marker escape (FR-123), full surface check (§15.7),
  `JsonPathBlockMap` (FR-091/094/122).
- **M2–M5** — ☐ not started. M2 folds the full catalog in by adding per-rule `include` fragments (the
  M1 mechanism already supports it: `generateCodec`'s rule list + `G_*` arms; AC-034).

## Next steps (ordered)

1. **Resolve the `round-trip-reviewer` verdict** on the M1 codec (in flight). Address any must-fix
   (re-run `pnpm -r test` + `UPDATE_ARTIFACTS=1 …` if a generator changes so the regen gate stays
   byte-equal), then **commit the codec slice as one change** — the staged `packages/editor-core/src/codec/`
   + `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/` + `check_no_codec_mapping.py` + the traceability/ROADMAP
   updates already made. Then re-run `update_memory.py --state` so the header points at the codec commit.
2. **Finish the remaining M1 scope** (each its own `/implement-requirement`, test-first; all build on the
   proven codec): **T5** literal-marker escape — recognize the exact `{$:object,fields:…}` shape →
   `transon_object_literal` (FR-123) + a configurable document marker (FR-063), order-independent
   key-set check (engine key order is insertion order, not sorted); **T6** full surface check beyond
   unknown-rule — undeclared params / zero-or-multiple variant match → `import_unsupported` (§15.7, §16.4);
   **T7** `JsonPathBlockMap` produced during the codec walk (FR-091/094/122) — needs threading
   `{node, path}` context through the recursion to emit `block_id`/`template_path` (consumed in M4).
3. Then **M2** (`/run-milestone M2`): fold the full catalog by adding per-rule fragments to
   `generateCodec`'s rule list + the `G_*` arms (no skeleton change; AC-034). Watch field-`kind` params
   (attr is all-dynamic; M2/M3 introduce field-vs-input disposition, FR-118).
4. (Optional) push `m1-codec-skeleton` + open a PR referencing the M1 IDs (one branch/PR per milestone).
5. (Deferred, M-09) Pin `transon` in CI and flip `check_engine_parity.py --require-engine` +
   `update_memory.py --check --require-engine` on, once the engine is pip-installable in CI.
