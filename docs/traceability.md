# traceability.md — Requirement Traceability

> **Version:** 2.0 · **Status:** Pre-implementation baseline · **Last updated:** 2026-06-27

> **v2.0 — template-driven projection pivot.** Adds coverage rows for the projection surface

> anti-drift gates: the engine-parity check now compares **pre-derived variant signatures** and
> **resolved enum domains**, a **codec-regeneration** check guards that committed codec artifacts
> match the current metadata (AD-030), and the round-trip corpus is anchored by the

Tracks every requirement in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) through to code and tests, per the SPEC-first /
tests-required discipline (`SPEC.md` §21.1, §21.2, §21.13). Architecture is in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md); the metadata shape in
[`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md).

> Milestone-level status (M0–M5) lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); this file tracks
> per-requirement-ID coverage.

> **Status legend:** [ ] pending · [~] in progress · [x] done.
> The whole project is **pre-implementation**, so everything below is [ ] until code and tests
> land. Update the row (and add the test reference) in the same change that implements a
> requirement.

## How to keep this current

1. Cite the requirement ID in each test name or comment, e.g.
   `test('imports attr name variant', ...)  // FR-054`.
2. To find an ID's tests, grep the codebase for the ID (e.g. `FR-054`).
3. To list all IDs in the spec, grep `docs/SPEC.md` for `FR-\d+`, `AC-\d+`, etc.
4. Before a PR: every implemented FR must have a referencing test; flag any test that references
   a non-existent or `(deprecated)` ID.

Suggested one-shot check (manual until automated):

```bash
# IDs defined in the spec
grep -oE '\b(FR|AC)-[0-9]+\b' docs/SPEC.md | sort -u > /tmp/spec_ids.txt
# IDs referenced in tests
grep -rhoE '\b(FR|AC)-[0-9]+\b' --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' src test \
  | sort -u > /tmp/test_ids.txt
# requirements with no test reference
comm -23 /tmp/spec_ids.txt /tmp/test_ids.txt
```

## Engine-parity checks (anti-drift)

`SPEC.md` declares the Transon engine authoritative (NFR-004, §21.4) and enumerates the
rule/operator/function catalog (FR-040..FR-042, §14.14, §14.15). These hand-lists drift silently
when the engine changes. The following automated checks must exist and pass; they are the primary
defense against spec/engine drift:

| Check | Asserts | Source of truth | Status |
|-------|---------|-----------------|:------:|
| Rule parity | editor supported rule set == the engine rule set | `Transformer.get_rules()` (currently 22: this, parent, item, index, key, value, set, get, attr, object, map, filter, zip, file, join, chain, expr, call, format, include, switch, cond) | [x] `harness/scripts/check_engine_parity.py` |
| Operator parity | editor operator list == engine operators | `transon/operators.py` (`Transformer.get_operators()`) | [x] `harness/scripts/check_engine_parity.py` |
| Function parity | editor function list == engine functions | `transon/functions.py` (`Transformer.get_functions()`) | [x] `harness/scripts/check_engine_parity.py` |
| Variant-signature parity | each rule's pre-derived `variants` are well-formed (ids + `required` flags, params drawn from the rule) | engine editor-metadata export, pre-derived `variants` ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §2.5, §3) | [x] `harness/scripts/check_engine_parity.py` |
| Resolved-enum parity | `expr.op`/`call.name` `options` == engine operator/function catalogs | engine export `options` ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §2.6) | [x] `harness/scripts/check_engine_parity.py` |
| Metadata export parity | export has the contract shape (split `catalog`/`docs`, per-rule `name`/`params`/`variants`, per-param `kind`, `metadata_version`) | engine `get_editor_metadata()` ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §3) | [x] `harness/scripts/check_engine_parity.py` |
| Codec-regeneration | committed codec artifacts (encoder/decoder + palette/toolbox) == re-running `G_*` on the current metadata (compare-only; writes only under `UPDATE_ARTIFACTS=1`) | `G_*` projections + build-time codegen (`SPEC.md` FR-119, AD-030) | [~] encoder/decoder: `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/regen.test.ts` (palette/toolbox M3) |
| Behavior-runtime size | the rule-agnostic behavior runtime gains no per-rule branch as the catalog grows | `SPEC.md` NFR-046, AD-031 | [ ] |
| Workspace-shape validity | encoder output is valid Blockly workspace-serialization JSON over the fixed block vocabulary (`transon_rule_<rule>__<variant>`, `transon_literal`/`transon_array`/`transon_object_literal`/`transon_unsupported`) across the §15.8 corpus | `SPEC.md` FR-124, AD-032 | [~] M1 corpus subset: `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/workspace-shape.test.ts` (full §15.8 in M2) |
| `JsonPathBlockMap` produced as the codec walks | the encoder emits the path→block map during the codec walk (not a separate post-pass); every JSON path maps to its block or nearest enclosing block over the §15.8 corpus | `SPEC.md` FR-122, §9.12 | [ ] |
| No codec↔workspace mapping (repo-scan) | no module under `packages/*/src` maps codec artifacts to/from a `{type, inputs, fields}` block structure | `SPEC.md` FR-126, AD-032 | [x] `harness/scripts/check_no_codec_mapping.py` (+ `--selftest`) |
| Encoder output loads in Blockly | encoder output deserializes via Blockly's workspace loader without error (headless) | `SPEC.md` FR-126 | [ ] |
| Palette definitions load | every complete-metadata rule yields a loadable/instantiable Zelos block definition (headless) | `SPEC.md` FR-125 | [ ] |
| Presentation source-scan | no §12.4 category names / order / category→colour map / per-rule title/category/advanced as TypeScript literals under `packages/*/src`; every metadata rule has a presentation-data entry | `SPEC.md` FR-127, NFR-048; [`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §2.9 | [ ] |

A failing parity check means either the engine changed (update the editor + spec together) or the
editor drifted (fix the editor). Never silence the check by editing the expectation without a
corresponding `SPEC.md` change (§21.2).

## Round-trip corpus

Round-trip is the core trust property (`SPEC.md` §7.5, AD-004, AD-011, AC-011). The corpus is
defined in `SPEC.md` §15.8 and must cover: simple literals; literal arrays; literal objects;
literal marker-key objects; every built-in rule; every block variant; nested templates;
docs/example-corpus templates; custom marker configuration; and import-failure cases.

| Corpus group | SPEC ref | Status | Test reference |
|--------------|----------|:------:|----------------|
| Literals (scalar/array/object) | §15.8 | [~] | `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/roundtrip.test.ts` (scalar type fidelity, empties, nesting) |
| Literal marker-key object | §15.8, §11.4 | [ ] | escape (FR-123) deferred past M1; marker-key objects currently round-trip via `transon_unsupported` |

| Every block variant | §15.8, §7.7 | [ ] | |

| Import-failure cases | §15.8, §17 | [ ] | |
| Round-trip by construction (per rule, generated codec) | §15.1, FR-115, AC-035 | [~] | `attr` prototype: `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/roundtrip.test.ts` (structural + execution identity); full catalog M2 |
| Self-hosting projection template | §7.16, FR-121, UC-016, AC-036 | [ ] | a `G_*`/codec template imports + round-trips as a normal in-surface template |
| Workspace-shape invariant (per corpus entry) | §15.8, FR-124, AD-032 | [~] | `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/workspace-shape.test.ts` (M1 corpus subset; asserts the fixed vocabulary + catches malformed blocks) |

## Non-functional & architecture decisions

NFRs (§8) and ADs ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §3) are largely verified by
integration/security tests and review rather than 1:1 unit tests. Key ones expected to have
dedicated tests:

| AD-031 / NFR-046 | Finite rule-agnostic behavior runtime; no per-rule growth | behavior-runtime size check | [ ] |
| AD-032 / FR-124/126 | No hand-written codec↔Blockly mapping; codec emits/consumes workspace JSON directly | workspace-shape validator + encoder-loads-in-Blockly + repo-scan gates | [~] workspace-shape validator + FR-126 repo-scan: `test/engine-node-adapter/test/codec/workspace-shape.test.ts`, `harness/scripts/check_no_codec_mapping.py` (Blockly-load gate M3) |

## Open questions

OQ-001..009 were ratified at v1.1 and OQ-010..017 at v2.0; all are folded into requirements. The
decision table and the "folded into" references are in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) §"Open questions".
No editor open questions remain blocking; the projection requirements (FR-114..121, NFR-046/047,
AC-034..036, UC-016, AD-026..031) and bidirectional-editing requirements (FR-111..113, AC-033) are
tracked in the tables above.
