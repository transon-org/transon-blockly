# ROADMAP.md — Implementation Roadmap

> **Version:** 2.1 · **Status:** Pre-implementation baseline · **Last updated:** 2026-07-05

> **v2.1 — M6 canvas density + navigation (RFC-003 phases 1–3).** New milestone **M6** (SPEC v2.1:
> §7.17 FR-133/FR-134, NFR-049, AC-041, the §12.5 OQ-018 label revision). **OQ-018…OQ-020
> ratified** (see §"Open questions"). The RFC's P-E (balanced adaptive inline/external layout,
> ratified in principle by OQ-019) is **not** in M6 — it prototypes first and lands as its own
> milestone (M7) with its own SPEC IDs.

> **v2.0 — template-driven projection pivot.** Milestones are resequenced around the projection
> model (`SPEC.md` §7.16, `ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-026…AD-031): (M0) engine `switch`/`cond` +
> projection-ready split metadata export; (M1) the codec skeleton + `G_encode`/`G_decode` for **one
> rule** end-to-end with round-trip identity (the de-risk prototype); (M2) the full catalog folded in
> via per-rule `include` fragments; (M3) `G_palette`/`G_toolbox` + Blockly Zelos + the finite
> behavior runtime; (M4) UI shell + host execution wiring + bidirectional sync; (M5) embedding,
> examples, accessibility, self-hosting demo. OQ-010…OQ-017 are ratified (see §"Open questions").
> The prior hand-written codec/IR/block-generation plan (the superseded AD-014/AD-016 model) is
> scrapped; only `docs/` carry forward (RFC migration plan).

> **v1.1.** OQ-001…OQ-009 are ratified (see §"Open questions"). Project-bootstrap decisions are
> now locked (license, npm scope, reference runtime, bidirectional editing). M0 is expanded to
> emit `title`/`category`/`advanced`/`examples` alongside the metadata contract.

The ordered plan for building the Transon Visual Editor. This is the **sequencing + task layer**
between the contract docs ([`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) — the *what*, [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
— the *how*, [`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) — the metadata *shape*) and the code.
It introduces no new requirements — every item references a SPEC/AD ID. If a slice would change
behavior, update `SPEC.md` first (§21.2) and never renumber IDs (§21.1).

> **Status legend:** ☐ pending · ◐ in progress · ☑ done.
> Track granular requirement → code → test coverage in [`traceability.md`](traceability.md);
> this file tracks **milestone-level** progress.

## How to use this file

1. Work milestones top-to-bottom; each is a **vertical slice** that ends green. The headless
   round-trip core (`editor-core`) is the first deliverable.
2. Per requirement: write the test (citing the ID, e.g. `// FR-035`) → implement → update the
   matching row in `traceability.md` in the same change.
3. Keep the engine-parity (anti-drift) checks green: the editor's rule/operator/function and
   variant sets are derived from the engine `editor_metadata` export, never hand-maintained
   (`traceability.md`, AD-012); and the committed codec artifacts must match a fresh re-run of the
   `G_*` projections on the current metadata (codec-regeneration check, AD-030).
4. A milestone is **done** only when its Definition of Done (below) is fully met.

## Locked decisions

These are settled ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §3). Do not relitigate without a
SPEC/ARCHITECTURE change.

- **Editor owns no runtime** (AD-008). All runtime concerns — validation, execution, `include`
  resolution, `file` capture — cross one host-provided `EngineProvider` boundary (`SPEC.md`
  §10.4). The exact runtime mechanism is the host's responsibility.
- **Engine-owned, versioned, projection-ready metadata** (AD-012, AD-026). Rules/params/operators/
  functions metadata is exported by the engine (`get_editor_metadata()`) in the projection-ready
  shape — pre-derived variant signatures + resolved enum domains, split into a structural catalog and
  an examples/docs payload (`metadata-contract.md` §2). The editor consumes it via the `G_*`
  projections and maintains no parallel catalog.
- **Editor surface = projections of metadata** (AD-026, compiler-only). Palette, toolbox, encoder,
  and decoder are Transon-template projections of the metadata; encode/decode derive from one source
  and are inverse by construction. **No interpreter codec, no typed IR, no hand-written per-rule block
  code** (supersedes the AD-014/AD-016 model).
- **Distinct-marker staging; no `eval`** (AD-027). Generators run with the meta-marker `@` and emit
  `$` codecs; `include` inherits the parent's default marker; the engine adds no `eval`/`apply` and
  no `quote`/`raw`.
- **`switch`/`cond` dispatch** (AD-029). Both lazy-dispatch rules are added to the engine and used at
  runtime inside the generated codec.
- **Build-time codegen, runtime execution** (AD-030). `G_*` run at build time into committed codec
  artifacts; the host engine runs those artifacts at runtime (two-pass generate-then-run).
- **Finite, rule-agnostic behavior runtime** (AD-031). Block behavior that JSON can't express is a
  fixed runtime that does not grow per rule (NFR-046).
- **Framework-agnostic surface** (AD-019). Vanilla `createTransonEditor()` + `<transon-editor>`
  web component + optional native React entry; React is internal.
- **Distribution** (AD-020). ESM primary (tree-shakeable) + self-contained IIFE global that
  auto-registers the web component; `.d.ts` types; CDN-ESM + importmap documented.
- **Execution-based round-trip, by construction** (AD-011, AD-026). Verify by executing the
  generated encoder/decoder (from one metadata source) through an injected engine; input-less corpus
  entries fall back to normalized-output + validation comparison. A real engine is needed in the test
  harness from M0.
- **Blockly Zelos renderer**, configurable (AD-017); **light DOM + scoped CSS** (AD-018).
- **Monorepo tooling** (AD-021): pnpm workspaces · Turborepo · Vite (library mode) · Vitest ·
  Changesets. Version pins are chosen at **M0** and reused by later milestones.
- **Reference host runtime** (AD-025). The shipped sandbox uses **in-browser Python `transon` via
  Pyodide/PyScript** (mirrors the docs site); round-trip CI uses the Node→Python adapter (AD-011).
  Production embedders may still supply any `EngineProvider` (AD-008).
- **Bidirectional JSON editing** is in v1 (AD-024), with strict in-surface sync (`SPEC.md` §7.15,
  FR-111…FR-113). This reverses the OQ-001 v1.0 draft.

### Project bootstrap (locked at v1.1)

- **License: MIT** — matches the `transon` engine (MIT, © Eugene Chernyshov).
- **npm scope: `@transon`** — verified available; packages follow the `@transon/editor-*` names in
  [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §5.1.
- **Repo:** this `transon-blockly` repository hosts the pnpm/Turborepo monorepo.
- **Version pins (recorded at M0, AD-021):** Node `>=20` (engines), pnpm `10.27.0`
  (`packageManager`), TypeScript `5.9.3`, Vite `6.4.3`, Vitest `2.1.9`, Turborepo `2.10.0`,
  `@changesets/cli` `2.31.0`. Blockly `13.0.0` is introduced at **M3** (`@transon/editor-blockly`,
  default Zelos renderer + behavior runtime). React `18.3.1` (internal UI dep) + jsdom/happy-dom test
  envs are introduced at **M4** (`editor-ui`, `@transon/editor-element`). Exact resolutions are locked
  in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Examples:** bundled at build time in v1; dynamic loading is future work (OQ-003).

## Definition of Done (every milestone)

- [ ] Each implemented FR has a test that cites its ID (`SPEC.md` §21.13, AC-027).
- [ ] `traceability.md` rows updated (status + test reference) in the same change.
- [ ] Engine-parity checks pass; the round-trip corpus is green for every rule/variant the slice
      touches (`SPEC.md` §15.8, §19.2); the codec-regeneration check passes (committed artifacts ==
      fresh `G_*` run, AD-030).
- [ ] No UI-only Blockly metadata stored in the executable template (`SPEC.md` §21.12).
- [ ] No hand-written codec/IR/per-rule block code reintroduced; new rule support is metadata +
      projection only (`SPEC.md` §21.15, NFR-046).
- [ ] No scope creep: still a visual Transon template editor, not a workflow platform
      (`SPEC.md` §4).

## M0 — Engine `switch`/`cond` + projection-ready export + test harness

**Goal:** the engine gains the two dispatch rules and emits the projection-ready, split
editor-metadata; a Node engine adapter is available for tests. Owner-controlled, lives mostly in the
Transon repo (this editor repo consumes the contract; see `metadata-contract.md` §6).

- Scope (requirements): **FR-047**, **FR-081**, **FR-116**, **FR-117**, **FR-118**; **AD-008**,
  **AD-012**, **AD-027**, **AD-029**; [`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §2, §6.
- Deliverables:
  - **Engine (transon repo):** `switch` and `cond` lazy-dispatch rules (`metadata-contract.md` §6.1);
    `include` default-marker inheritance (§6.3); `get_editor_metadata()` in the projection-ready
    shape — **pre-derived variant signatures** (§2.5), **resolved enum domains** (§2.6), per-param
    `kind`, `title`/`category`/`advanced`, **split** structural/examples payload (§2.7), and a
    standalone `metadata_version`.
  - **Editor repo:** a Node→Python `transon` `EngineProvider` test adapter
    (`test/engine-node-adapter`) able to **run generators and codecs** (parameterized by marker,
    `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.2) for M1's build-time codegen + execution round-trip; monorepo scaffolding
    + version pins recorded (AD-021); a metadata snapshot for M1.
- DoD additions: metadata-export-parity, variant-signature-parity, and resolved-enum-parity checks
  exist and pass against the engine export (`traceability.md`); the adapter can execute a template
  with markers `@` and `$`.
- **Status (☑ done; M-09 CI pin flip landed 2026-07-03).** The **engine half has landed** in the sibling `transon` repo: the
  `switch`/`cond` rules and the projection-ready `get_editor_metadata()` export exist and are pinned
  in [`docs/metadata-snapshot.json`](metadata-snapshot.json) (pinned at engine `v0.1.3` /
  `metadata_version 2.0` when M0 closed; the snapshot has since moved with the engine — `v0.1.6` /
  `3.0` as of 2026-07-03, see [`metadata-snapshot.md`](metadata-snapshot.md)); the
  export/variant/enum parity checks run against it. **Editor side (landed, reviewed):** the monorepo scaffolding
  + pinned tooling (AD-021), the engine-free `EngineProvider` port (`@transon/editor-core`, AD-008),
  the typed metadata-snapshot loader (AD-012/NFR-047), and the Node→Python `EngineProvider` test
  adapter (`test/engine-node-adapter`, AD-011) — `version()`/`validate()` round-trip and the `@`/`$`
  two-pass staging proof (FR-116/FR-119/AD-027/AD-030) both pass, signed off by an independent
  `round-trip-reviewer`. The M0 DoD additions (export/variant/enum parity + adapter runs `@`/`$`) are
  met. **The formerly deferred M-09 CI engine-pin flip landed 2026-07-03:** `transon` is on PyPI, so
  `agentic-checks` installs the snapshot-pinned wheel and runs parity + snapshot-drift with
  `--require-engine` (binding); `drift-watch` installs the *latest* wheel to catch upstream movement.
  Living status: [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md).

## M1 — `editor-core`: codec skeleton + `G_encode`/`G_decode` for one rule (de-risk prototype)

**Goal:** close the smallest end-to-end loop — generate a codec for **one rule** (e.g. `attr`) and
prove round-trip identity — before folding over the catalog. Pure data + host execution; no Blockly.

- Scope: **FR-114 … FR-119** (projections, generated codec, skeleton, dispatch, build-time codegen),
  **FR-124**, **FR-126** (codec output = Blockly workspace JSON directly; no mapping layer),
  **FR-019 … FR-039** (generation, import, round-trip semantics), **FR-059 … FR-063** + **FR-123**
  (literal / marker-key objects + custom marker — codec-level; skeleton-owned escape precedence),
  **§15.7** (supported surface), **FR-091** + **FR-094** + **FR-122** (`JsonPathBlockMap` produced by
  the skeleton as it walks; highlighting FRs **FR-092/093/095** land in M4), **§16.4** (error
  taxonomy); **AC-009 … AC-011**, **AC-035**; **AD-026**, **AD-028**, **AD-030**, **AD-032**, **AD-011**.
- **Engine prerequisite:** pin the metadata snapshot to an engine build (**v0.1.3+**) that provides
  the `type` function and the `include` `IncludeContext` loader the codec dispatch relies on
  ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §6.4/§6.5) before building the codec.
- Deliverables: the codec **skeleton** (recursion, literal passthrough, marker escape §11.4, ordering
  §15.3, surface check §15.7, out-of-surface placeholder §13.11); `G_encode`/`G_decode` (marker `@`)
  with the per-rule body factored into an `include`d fragment; build-time codegen producing committed
  encoder/decoder artifacts for the prototype rule; the `EngineProvider` port + error taxonomy; the
  execution-based round-trip check run via the M0 adapter.
- Pass criteria (RFC de-risk): `$`-structure emits verbatim under marker `@`; `@`-holes splice
  correctly; `include` carries everything via `this`; self-`include` recursion terminates within
  `max_include_depth`; **round-trip identity holds** for the prototype rule (AC-035).
- DoD additions (codec milestone): the **FR-124 workspace-shape validator** passes (encoder output is
  valid Blockly workspace-serialization JSON over the fixed vocabulary); the **FR-126 repo-scan**
  passes (no module under `packages/*/src` maps codec artifacts to/from a `{type, inputs, fields}`
  structure); encode/decode round-trip on the workspace shape (`decode(encode(T)) == T`); committed
  codec artifacts are **byte-equal** to a fresh `G_*` generation (compare-only regen gate, AD-030).
  (The FR-126 headless Blockly-load gate lands with Blockly in M3.)
- Implementation notes (codec/projection metaprogramming, carried from the de-risk prototype):
  - **Dispatch on node type** via a `switch` keyed by `{ call: type }` (not a structural heuristic):
    literal arrays recurse; literal marker-looking strings are scalars
    ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §6.4).
  - **`set`/`get` do NOT cross an `include` boundary** — a fragment receives its context as the `this`
    value passed into the include; reading a parent-scope variable across the include yields
    `NoContent` ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §6.5).
  - **Strict regeneration gate** — the regen check compares only (fails on drift) and writes solely
    under an explicit opt-in flag (e.g. `UPDATE_ARTIFACTS=1`); a self-writing gate rubber-stamps a
    wrong artifact ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) AD-030).
  - **Host recursion ceiling** — codec recursion is host-stack-bound (~25 levels), below the engine's
    `max_include_depth` (50); deeper nesting should fail cleanly with an `include_loader` error, not a
    raw stack overflow ([`metadata-contract.md`](metadata-contract.md) §6.5).
- **Status (☑ done — round-trip-reviewer-signed-off, all DoD gates green; not pushed).** The compiler
  model is **validated end-to-end** for the `attr` prototype: `G_encode`/`G_decode` arms are projected
  from the pinned metadata via `@`-staging over a fixed rule-agnostic skeleton (the generators are
  committed as inspectable JSON data and run load-bearing; AD-026); the committed encoder/decoder
  artifacts execute through the host `EngineProvider` and **round-trip by construction** —
  `decode(encode(T)) == T` structurally **and** semantic-identity by execution (AC-035) — over the M1
  corpus (literals incl. scalar-type fidelity, arrays/objects, both `attr` variants + optional
  `default`, nesting, out-of-surface → `transon_unsupported`). **Full M1 scope landed:** the
  skeleton-owned **literal-marker escape** with exact precedence (FR-059/060/061/062/123); the **exact
  variant-match surface check** (ambiguous/foreign `attr` → `transon_unsupported`, never silently
  rewritten — §15.7); the **`JsonPathBlockMap`** emitted alongside the workspace with unique,
  RFC-6901-escaped paths (FR-091/094/122, §9.12; *consumed* in M4); and **custom marker keys** via
  runtime marker substitution (FR-063). DoD additions met: the **FR-124 workspace-shape validator** and
  **FR-126 no-mapping repo-scan** pass; artifacts + generators are **byte-equal** to a fresh build
  (strict compare-only regen, AD-030); the codec output is Blockly workspace-serialization JSON directly
  (AD-032). Deep nesting fails **cleanly** with a `CodecError` below the host-stack limit (§6.5, codec
  `maxIncludeDepth` cap), not a raw stack overflow. The M0 adapter gained the v0.1.3 `include`
  `IncludeContext` loader + the `includes` bundle + `maxIncludeDepth` plumbing (engine-free;
  AD-008/011). Two independent `round-trip-reviewer` passes (maker≠checker) found + fixed two must-fix
  correctness bugs (value-sentinel collision; silent out-of-surface rewrite) and one should-fix
  (blockMap path uniqueness); all resolved + regression-locked. **133 tests pass.** Living status:
  [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md).

## M2 — Full catalog: fold every rule into the generated codec

**Goal:** extend the codec to the whole built-in catalog by **adding per-rule `include` fragments**,
not by growing one template; every rule and variant round-trips by construction.

- Scope: **FR-040 … FR-058** (rule coverage + pre-derived variant model & matching), **FR-120**
  (new rule across all surfaces from metadata), **FR-124** (workspace-shape invariant over the full
  corpus), **§15.6**, **§15.8** (corpus); **AC-006 … AC-008**, **AC-028**, **AC-029**, **AC-030**,
  **AC-034**, **AC-035**; **AD-026**, **AD-028**, **AD-029**, **AD-032**.
- Deliverables: per-rule encode/decode fragments for all 22 built-in rules (+ operators/functions via
  resolved enums), variant matching from the pre-derived signatures, the full execution-based
  round-trip corpus (`SPEC.md` §15.8) including custom marker and import-failure cases.
- DoD additions: round-trip corpus covers every built-in rule and variant; the **FR-124
  workspace-shape validator** runs over the full §15.8 corpus; ambiguous/partial variant matches
  reported as `import_unsupported`; adding a rule to the metadata snapshot makes it
  encode/decode/round-trip with **no projection-template change** (AC-034).
- **Status (☑ done — two `round-trip-reviewer` sign-offs, all DoD gates green; not pushed).** The full
  22-rule catalog round-trips by construction through the generated codec, folded in by **metadata +
  one rule-agnostic generator change**, no skeleton growth per rule (AC-034). Landed on `m2-full-catalog`
  in four reviewed slices: **D1 (`142bbc9`)** — catalog fold + the empty-operand-safe variant matcher
  (the M1 `expr and []` assumption breaks for the six zero-param rules → reframed onto the join-of-empty
  membership pattern); **D2 (`3925e18`)** — constant-param field-vs-input disposition (FR-118): the two
  `kind:"constant"` params (`expr.op`/`call.name`) project to block `fields`, dynamic params to `inputs`,
  via `kind` joined onto variant params in `generateCodec` (`enrichEntry`) so the generators branch at
  `@`-time; operators (28 tokens) + functions (4) round-trip with the constant verbatim in `fields`
  (FR-041/042, AC-007/008); **D3 (`6dfacdb`)** — the full §15.8 corpus: all **147** engine
  `docs.*.examples` round-trip (structural + execution identity), ambiguous/foreign import-failure →
  `transon_unsupported` + exact preservation (§15.6/FR-055), multi-rule custom marker, workspace-shape
  (FR-124) over the full 147 + corpus; **D4 (`69d1472`)** — the **AC-034** proof: a synthetic rule folds
  into the codec via a `generateCodec` catalog override with zero projection-file change. The example
  corpus surfaced + drove a fix to a real **object/fields escape collision** (the M1 literal-marker escape
  shadowed the folded-in `object`/`fields` RULE for marker-free payloads → round-trip + semantic break);
  fixed surgically (the escape fires only for a marker-bearing payload, §11.4) with FR-123/§11.4 refined
  (SPEC-first). The test bridge was hardened (runner.py serialization guard + adapter per-request timeout)
  so an unserializable engine output can no longer hang the suite. **760 tests pass** (754 adapter + 6
  editor-core); engine-parity, no-codec-mapping, traceability, and byte-equal codec-regeneration all green.
  Living status: [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md).

## M3 — `editor-blockly`: `G_palette`/`G_toolbox` + Zelos + behavior runtime

**Goal:** project the catalog to Blockly — palette/toolbox from metadata — and add the finite,
rule-agnostic behavior runtime; the generated codec reads/writes the Blockly workspace JSON.

- Scope: **FR-012 … FR-018** (workspace/literals), **FR-043 … FR-044** (categories), **FR-084**,
  **FR-088 … FR-090** (metadata-projected blocks), **FR-121** (projection templates are valid
  templates), **FR-125** (loadable palette block definitions), **FR-126** (headless Blockly-load of
  encoder output), **FR-127** + **NFR-048** (presentation/category/colour from data, single source);
  **NFR-046**; **AC-036**, **AC-037**; **AD-017**, **AD-018**, **AD-026**, **AD-031**, **AD-032**.
- Deliverables: `G_palette` (block definitions) + `G_toolbox` (categories from `SPEC.md` §12.4)
  projections rendered to Zelos; the committed **projection-data file** for editor-owned presentation
  (title/category/advanced + category order + category→colour, `metadata-contract.md` §2.9); the
  finite **behavior runtime** (field validators, widgets, mutator UI, connection rules, change events)
  that does not grow per rule; workspace⇄blocks wiring so the generated encoder/decoder operate on
  real workspace JSON; light-DOM scoped-prefix encapsulation (AD-018; shadow DOM is not viable).
- DoD additions (projection/editor milestone): the **FR-125 headless palette-load gate** (every
  complete-metadata rule yields a loadable Zelos definition); the **FR-126 headless gate** that the
  encoder output loads via Blockly's workspace deserialization; the **FR-127 + NFR-048 source-scan**
  (no category/colour/presentation TypeScript literals under `packages/*/src`) and the
  presentation-completeness check; the **AC-037 synthetic-rule test** driving presentation from the
  data file; a new rule with complete metadata appears as a projected block with no editor code
  change (AC-034); the behavior-runtime-size check shows no per-rule growth (NFR-046).
- **Status (☑ done — `round-trip-reviewer`-signed-off, all DoD gates green; not pushed).** The metadata
  catalog is projected to the full Blockly surface, folded in by metadata + the `G_palette`/`G_toolbox`
  projections + the committed presentation-data file — **no per-rule code** (AC-037/NFR-046). Landed on
  `m3-editor-blockly` in reviewed slices: **D0 (`12b2751`)** — the new `@transon/editor-blockly` package
  (Blockly `13.0.0`, AD-021) + `presentation.json` (the §2.9 single source: per-rule title/category/
  advanced + category order + category→colour) + the FR-127/NFR-048 `check_presentation.py` gate
  (source-scan + completeness); **D1 (`e17b28f`)** — `G_toolbox` → committed `toolbox.json` (the §12.4
  categories in order, colours from data); **D2 (`16d59ca`)** — `G_palette` → committed `palette.json`
  (34 Zelos block defs; the FR-118 widget — dynamic→`input_value`, constant+options→`field_dropdown`,
  constant→`field_input` — decided IN the projection via `@:cond`, mirroring the encoder's disposition;
  label "<title> (<rule>)", colour from category); **D3a (`3b2e515`)** — the finite rule-agnostic behavior
  runtime (1 custom field + 3 structural mutators, NFR-046) + the FR-125 headless palette-load gate (all 34
  defs register + instantiate) + the FR-126 headless encoder-load gate (the full 147-example + M1 corpus
  loads in Blockly); **D3b (`cd18877`)** — the NFR-046 `check_behavior_runtime_size.py` gate + AC-037 (a
  synthetic rule projects from data with the runtime untouched) + AC-036 (the M3 projections are in-surface).
  The projections forced **one rule-agnostic skeleton change** — the encoder's array arm now emits
  `extraState.items` so the Blockly mutator can rebuild the `ITEM{n}` inputs (Blockly errors on a connection
  to an undeclared input, and counting them in TS would violate the no-codec-mapping scan); the decoder
  ignores it, so round-trip is unchanged. The independent `round-trip-reviewer` (maker≠checker) refuted
  nothing in M3 scope and found one SHOULD-FIX — a latent crash on the reverse Blockly-save→decode path for
  an empty array (Blockly drops an empty `inputs:{}`) — **fixed** (`f4de4c8`: decoder `inputs default {}`) +
  promoted to a proven **FR-126 reverse-path gate** (`blockly-resave.test.ts`, 217 cases: encode→Blockly
  load→save→decode over the full corpus, incl. scalar type fidelity). **1387 tests** (1364 adapter + 12 core
  + 11 blockly); byte-equal regen (encoder/decoder/toolbox/palette), no-codec-mapping, behavior-runtime-size,
  presentation, engine-parity, traceability, maturity — all green. **M3/M4 boundary:** the headless gates
  verify loadability without a DOM; the interactive Zelos render into a light-DOM scoped container
  (AD-017/AD-018) + the editor-sync UI (§7.15) land in M4 with jsdom/browser. Living status:
  [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md).

## M4 — `editor-ui` + `editor-element`: shell, host execution, bidirectional sync

**Goal:** the runnable editor in both UI modes, wired to a host engine that runs both user templates
and the projection codecs across the boundary.

- Scope: **FR-001 … FR-011** (shell + modes), **FR-064 … FR-076** (validation/execution via the
  host), **FR-091 … FR-095** (error highlighting UI), **FR-005** + **FR-111 … FR-113**
  (bidirectional JSON editing, now via the generated decoder/encoder), **§10.4** (host boundary);
  **AC-001**, **AC-012 … AC-017**, **AC-023 … AC-025**, **AC-031**, **AC-032**, **AC-033**, **AC-038**
  (on-canvas structural mutators, §13.13); **NFR-028**, **NFR-046** (mutator stays rule-agnostic),
  **AD-019**, **AD-020**, **AD-024**, **AD-025**, **AD-030**, **AD-031**.
- Deliverables: panels + sandbox/compact modes + `EditorSession` store (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6);
  interactive Zelos render into a light-DOM scoped container (AD-017/018, jsdom); error→block
  highlighting from the skeleton-produced `JsonPathBlockMap`; strict bidirectional JSON
  editing (valid in-surface edit syncs back via the encoder; otherwise error + workspace unchanged —
  AD-024, §7.15); on-canvas array/object **add/remove mutators** in the rule-agnostic behavior
  runtime (§13.13, AC-038); `createTransonEditor()` + `<transon-editor>` (ESM + IIFE,
  `@transon/editor-element`); the **reference** host engine adapter (in-browser Python `transon` via
  Pyodide, eager-load-on-mount with surfaced status, `examples/reference-host`, AD-025) that runs user
  templates **and** the codecs; captured `file` writes view (§17.11); include loader wiring (§17.10).
- DoD additions: the **visual ⇄ JSON projection runs the codec through the host engine** (AD-026/030),
  so with no host engine (or before `ready`) generation/import-sync are disabled alongside
  validate/run — only block authoring + raw JSON text handling remain (§10.4); engine runtime status
  (idle/loading/ready/failed) is surfaced (NFR-028, AC-023); the §7.15 reverse sync is strict (valid
  in-surface edit syncs via the encoder, otherwise error + workspace unchanged, AC-033); the
  mutator-driven structure round-trips identically to JSON-authored structure (AC-038); the behavior
  runtime stays rule-agnostic after the mutator addition (NFR-046 size gate).
- **Status (☑ done — `round-trip-reviewer`-signed-off, all DoD gates green; not pushed).** The runnable
  editor in both UI modes, wired to a host engine that runs user templates **and** the projection
  codecs. Landed on `m4-editor-ui` (off `m3-editor-blockly`) in reviewed slices: **SPEC-first (`1902f64`)**
  — resolved the design STOPs: §10.4/§17.9 corrected so the visual⇄JSON projection is engine-gated
  (the prior "engine-free generation" was superseded pre-pivot text), ARCH §6/§6.4 encode/decode naming
  fixed, AC-038 + §13.13 on-canvas mutators added (out of "Future"); **D0 (`4da6c18`)** — the three new
  packages (`@transon/editor-ui` private React+jsdom, `@transon/editor-element` public, `examples/
  reference-host`) + AD-021 pins (React 18.3.1, @vitejs/plugin-react 5.2.0, jsdom 27.4.0); **D1
  (`58b6dd6`)** — the framework-agnostic `EditorSession` store (§9.3 + flow fields) + forward projection
  (workspace→JSON via core `decode`+`blockMap`, gated on engine-ready) + the §16.4 taxonomy; **D2
  (`204c0ac`)** — the React shell (sandbox §12.1 / compact §12.2 over the `EditorController`), the
  interactive light-DOM Zelos mount (AD-017/018, verified Blockly 13 `inject` works under jsdom with the
  En locale + SVG/canvas stubs), the editable `field_transon_scalar` (FR-015, typed fidelity), and the
  AC-038 +/- mutators (object keys became editable fields collected into `extraState.keys`, decoder
  contract unchanged); **D3 (`b9703d2`)** — validate/execute via the host (AC-012…016), captured `file`
  writes (AC-024), include loader (AC-025), `json_input` validation, engine status (AC-023), and the
  Pyodide reference host (`createPyodideHost`, glue mirrors `runner.py` over a JSON-string boundary,
  no `eval`, AD-025/030); **D4 (`8f698a4`)** — error→block highlighting: a path-index↔block_map walk
  (Blockly API, scan-clean) resolving exact / nearest-parent / root (FR-091…095, AC-017); **D5
  (`e32e04a`)** — strict bidirectional sync §7.15 (`tryReverse`: parse→encode→surface-check→round-trip
  gate; accept loads, reject leaves the workspace unchanged — FR-111…113, AC-033, AD-024); **D6
  (`8b0b9ba`)** — `createTransonEditor()` + `<transon-editor>` (light DOM, ESM + self-contained IIFE,
  ships no engine — AD-019/020/008, AC-022) + the runnable Pyodide playground. The independent
  `round-trip-reviewer` (maker≠checker) refuted every concern except one **must-fix** — the §7.15 surface
  check matched the bare token `transon_unsupported` anywhere in the serialized block, so an in-surface
  document whose *data* contained that string was wrongly rejected (FR-111) — **fixed (`98e70eb`)** with a
  structural block-type walk + a 4-case regression. **1477 tests** (core 12 + blockly 16 + ui 41 +
  element 12 + adapter 1389 + reference-host 7); no-codec-mapping, behavior-runtime-size, presentation,
  engine-parity, traceability, maturity, evals — all green. **M5 carry-over:** `@transon/editor-react`,
  example expected-vs-actual UX, import/export UX (FR-096…110), full embedding API, accessibility, and the
  self-hosting demo. Living status: [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md).

## M5 — React entry, examples, embedding, accessibility & self-hosting

**Goal:** complete the consumer-facing surface, example-driven learning, accessibility, and the
self-hosting demonstration.

- Scope: **FR-077 … FR-082** (docs/editor metadata, diagnostics), **FR-096 … FR-101** (import/export
  UX), **FR-102 … FR-110** + **FR-128** (component embedding + chrome-only theming contract),
  **FR-058** (constant-choice dropdowns from resolved enums), **FR-121** (self-hosting); **NFR-045**,
  **§19.5**; **AC-018 … AC-022**, **AC-026**, **AC-036**, **AC-039** (accessibility baseline); **AD-019**.
  (FR-128 + AC-039 added SPEC-first at M5 start: FR-108 theming and NFR-045 a11y were `should`-level
  with no normative contract/DoD — ratified with the recommended minimal designs.)
- Deliverables: `@transon/editor-react` (`<TransonEditor>` with React as a peer); example loading from
  the corpus with expected-vs-actual output; embedding callbacks (`onChange`/`onValidate`/`onExecute`);
  read-only/theming/marker configuration; progressive disclosure (`SPEC.md` §12.6); the self-hosting
  demo/test (open a `G_*`/codec template in the editor, AC-036, UC-016); keyboard
  navigation/contrast/focus/screen-reader labels and the accessibility test suite.
- **Status (☑ done — `round-trip-reviewer`-signed-off, all DoD gates green; not pushed).** The
  complete consumer-facing surface, on `m5-react-embedding` (off `m4-editor-ui`). **SPEC-first
  (`26691ee`)**: ratified **FR-128** (theming = scoped `--transon-*` CSS custom properties, chrome-only;
  block/category colours stay data-driven, FR-127) and **AC-039** (accessibility baseline binding the
  §19.5 suite to a checkable DoD) — both were `should`-level with no normative contract/DoD.
  **Slices:** **D0 (`4404b3d`)** — new public `@transon/editor-react` (`<TransonEditor ref>` with React
  as a **peer** — the internals + Blockly bundled, React/engine external; a build test proves React is
  peer-not-bundled, AD-019) + embedding callbacks now carry the engine `ValidationResult`/
  `ExecutionResult` payloads (FR-011/105/106). **D1 (`b68b1f6`)** — the embedding config surface over the
  one `EditorControllerOptions` funnel: read-only (FR-107), chrome-only CSS-var theming (FR-108/128),
  configurable §12.4 categories (FR-109, filter over a copy), custom-marker import/export round-trip
  (FR-110/AC-026, real-engine), `<transon-editor>` event payloads in `detail` (FR-011). **D2 (`0ddb2bd`)**
  — the example corpus (`buildExampleCorpus`: 147 raw docs examples → 89 content-deduped `ExampleCase`)
  + Examples picker + `loadExample` + expected-vs-actual OutputPanel with a non-colour match label
  (FR-009/075/076/079/099, AC-018/019). **D3 (`2edf480`)** — import (file → §7.15 gate)/copy/download
  (canonical-only, §11.6) + the FR-101 unsaved-changes guard (`confirmReplace`) + no-backend
  (FR-096…101, AC-021). **D4 (`5a49cfb`)** — metadata tooltips (FR-078/AC-020, graceful FR-077),
  engine+metadata versions in diagnostics (FR-080, NFR-040 mismatch flag), the FR-058 dropdown cited,
  and §12.6 progressive disclosure (advanced-blocks toggle + palette search — **data-driven from the
  committed `presentation.json`, no `G_toolbox` regen**, so the codec stays byte-unchanged).
  **D5 (`630186f`)** — self-hosting through the running editor (UC-016): the §7.15 import gate accepts
  `G_palette`/`G_toolbox` (in-surface + round-trip faithful) and the forward projection regenerates them
  identically; the deepest `G_encode`/`G_decode` exceed the host-stack recursion ceiling (§6.5) and are
  rejected cleanly. **D6 (`689a50c`)** — accessibility (NFR-045/AC-039): a committed scoped light-DOM
  stylesheet (AA-contrast `--transon-*` tokens + `:focus-visible`), an ARIA audit (labels on every major
  panel/region, status `role=status`/`aria-live`), and a deterministic jsdom axe scan (0 critical/serious
  ARIA violations) — **real-browser verified** via the reference-host (axe **0 violations incl. contrast**,
  visible focus, and the in-browser **Pyodide engine reaches `ready`**, closing the M4 CI-unverified
  watch-out). The independent `round-trip-reviewer` (maker≠checker) verified **codec byte-identity**
  (editor-core tree hash unchanged vs M4 — no drift/regen), refuted every correctness concern (marker
  consistency under 5 adversarial probes, faithful self-hosting, un-weakened import gate, additive
  callbacks), and found one SHOULD-FIX — the §6.5 depth-cap `CodecError` was mislabelled
  `import_unsupported` (≡ a surface violation) instead of the runtime limit it is — **fixed (`1cf0be6`)**
  → `runtime_transformation` + a D5 assertion. **1551 tests** (core 12 + blockly 20 + ui 92 + element 12
  + react 5 + adapter 1403 + reference-host 7); typecheck + no-codec-mapping + behavior-runtime-size +
  presentation + engine-parity + traceability + maturity + evals — all green. Living status:
  [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md).

## M6 — Canvas density + navigation (RFC-003 phases 1–3)

**Goal:** large templates become navigable and the canvas ~2× denser at full legibility, with
zero codec/round-trip impact (`SPEC.md` §21.12). Makes NFR-029 checkable via the NFR-049 harness.
Design + rationale + per-phase gains: [RFC-003](proposals/rfc-003-canvas-density-and-navigation.md).

- Scope: **FR-133** (zoom controls / wheel+pinch / zoom-to-fit / minimap / pan, OQ-020),
  **FR-134** (subtree collapse, UI-only per §11.5), the **§12.5 label revision** (OQ-018:
  canvas title-only, flyout dual label, tooltip `<rule> — <description>` per FR-078,
  single-input variants drop the param-name prefix, optional short param labels in presentation
  data per `metadata-contract.md` §2.9), **NFR-049** (density target + measurement harness),
  **NFR-029**; **AC-041**. Display-only throughout — codec artifacts change only by `G_palette`
  regeneration (byte-equal regen gate, AD-030).
- Deliverables, in phase order (RFC-003 sequencing):
  1. **Navigation (P-A + P-D):** `zoom`/`move` inject options + zoom-to-fit + the pinned
     `@blockly/workspace-minimap` plugin (AD-021 pin) + `collapse` enabled with context menu;
     collapsed custom fields/mutators verified.
  2. **Labels (P-C):** `G_palette` label projection change (title-only `message0`, conditional
     param-name prefix) + flyout dual label + tooltip prefix + presentation short-label key;
     regenerate committed artifacts (AD-030).
  3. **Compact surface (P-B):** thrasos-derived renderer constants tuned against the example
     corpus + the NFR-049 density harness with committed baseline numbers.
- **Explicitly out of scope:** P-E adaptive inline/external layout (ratified OQ-019) — it
  requires a prototype on the largest corpus examples before its SPEC revision (new FR/AD IDs at
  next-free when it lands) and becomes **M7**. Do not change `inputsInline`, §13.10, FR-129, or
  AC-040 in M6.
- DoD additions (beyond the standard Definition of Done): AC-041 green including the real-browser
  layer (§19.4); NFR-049 harness numbers committed; round-trip corpus **zero-diff**; `G_palette`
  regen byte-equal after the label change.
- **Status: ☐ pending.**

## Readiness assessment

The specification set is complete for pre-implementation: behavior (`FR/NFR/AC/UC`), domain model,
error taxonomy, supported surface (§15.7), the projection model + generated codec
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.4–§5.8), the projection-ready metadata contract, and the traceability scaffold
are all defined. The main risk is now the **two-level metaprogramming** of the compiler model, which
M1 deliberately de-risks on one rule before the catalog is folded in (RFC validation strategy). With
engine-ownership, the host boundary, and the projection-ready export settled, there is no blocking
conflict.

| Milestone | Ready? | Prerequisites / notes |
|---|:--:|---|
| M0 (engine rules + export) | 🟢 ready | Owner-controlled: `switch`/`cond` rules, `include` marker inheritance, projection-ready split export (AD-012/027/029), Node adapter able to run markers `@`/`$` (AD-008). |
| M1 (codec skeleton + one-rule codec) | 🟢 ready after M0 | The de-risk prototype; needs M0's export + adapter. Pass criteria gate the rest of the plan. |
| M2 (full catalog) | 🟢 after M1 | Fold per-rule `include` fragments once M1's loop closes; no new mechanism. |
| M3 (Blockly projections + behavior runtime) | 🟢 done | `G_palette`/`G_toolbox` projections + committed palette/toolbox; the finite rule-agnostic behavior runtime (AD-031); FR-125/126/127 + NFR-046 gates; AC-036/037. Interactive Zelos render (AD-017/018) + editor-sync UI → M4. |
| M4 (UI + runtime) | 🟢 done | Shell (sandbox/compact) + `EditorSession` store + interactive light-DOM Zelos mount (AD-017/018, jsdom) + host validate/execute + error highlighting + strict §7.15 sync + `createTransonEditor()`/`<transon-editor>` (ESM+IIFE, no engine) + the Pyodide reference host (AD-025). `round-trip-reviewer`-signed-off. |
| M5 | 🟢 done | React entry (`@transon/editor-react`, React peer) + full embedding config (read-only/theming/categories/marker) + examples with expected-vs-actual + import/export UX + diagnostics/tooltips + §12.6 progressive disclosure + self-hosting (UC-016) + accessibility (§19.5, real-browser axe-verified). `round-trip-reviewer`-signed-off; codec byte-unchanged. |

### Remaining inputs to define before coding starts

1. **Engine `switch`/`cond` + `include` marker inheritance.** The dispatch rules and the
   default-marker inheritance must land in the engine repo (`metadata-contract.md` §6); the generated
   codec depends on them. Owner-controlled.
2. **Projection-ready export shape sign-off.** Confirm the exact JSON shape — pre-derived variant
   signatures, resolved enum domains, per-param `kind`, split structural/examples payload — against
   `metadata-contract.md` §2 before M1 consumes a snapshot. Includes per-parameter `kind` values and
   built-in `title`/`category`/`advanced` + `examples` wiring.
3. **Node engine adapter contract.** The test `EngineProvider` (Node→Python `transon`) must be stood
   up in M0 and be able to run generators (`@`) and codecs (`$`) so M1's build-time codegen +
   execution round-trip can run.
4. **Prototype rule choice.** Pick the M1 prototype rule (RFC suggests `attr`) and author its
   projection-ready metadata + the `G_encode`/`G_decode` per-rule fragment first.

> **Verdict: green-light M0 + M1 now.** They depend only on owner-controlled inputs above.
> Recommended first step is **M0** (engine `switch`/`cond` + projection-ready export + Node adapter
> that can run both markers), since M1's de-risk prototype depends on it.

## Open questions

OQ-001…OQ-009 were ratified at v1.1, OQ-010…OQ-017 at v2.0, and OQ-018…OQ-020 at v2.1
(2026-07-05, [RFC-003](proposals/rfc-003-canvas-density-and-navigation.md)); all are folded into
requirements. Earlier-resolved questions had already become architecture decisions: two
metadata-ownership questions → AD-012, equivalence-testing → AD-011, framework choice → AD-019.
(The former generic/specialized questions resolved into the now-superseded AD-014, and are
re-expressed by the projection model AD-026/AD-031.)

| ID | Question | Ratified decision | Status | Folded into |

| OQ-007 | How to display captured `file` writes? | Separate "Files produced" panel with name + content preview. | ☑ | SPEC §12.11, §17.11 |
| OQ-008 | Rule names vs friendly labels on blocks? | Show both, e.g. "Get attribute (`attr`)". **Superseded on the canvas by OQ-018 (2026-07-05)**: dual label now flyout-only. | ☑ | SPEC §12.5 (revised at v2.1) |
| OQ-009 | Palette size management with per-shape variants? | Categories + search + advanced toggle + clear labels; prefer a clearer palette over hidden modes. | ☑ | SPEC §12.6 |

| OQ-019 | Inline/external layout split for value inputs? | **Adaptive + manual override** (runtime flips on connection changes, damped; per-block override wins) — ratified in principle; the prototype pins the multiline threshold + damping **before** the SPEC revision lands (M7, not M6). | ☑ | RFC-003 P-E (SPEC IDs assigned at M7) |
| OQ-020 | Minimap: adopt now or defer? | **Adopt now** — `@blockly/workspace-minimap` ships in M6 phase 1 (overrides RFC-003's proposed defer). | ☑ | SPEC §7.17 FR-133; RFC-003 P-A |

## Future considerations

Not v1 requirements. Any future feature must be evaluated against the project goal: keep the
product a visual editor for Transon templates, not a general workflow automation platform.

- JSFiddle-style share links (AD-023); backend persistence; user accounts; saved template
  library; Git-backed template storage; collaborative editing;
- direct JSON editing with sync back to Blockly; side-by-side visual diff; template versioning;
  approval workflow;
- custom rule authoring UI; custom rule plugin packs; generated block packs from extension
  metadata;
- **richer block-composition UX (post-M3, projection-driven)** — ideas to improve "blocks look
  basic / only slots", all expressible through metadata + the `G_palette`/codec projections and the
  finite behavior runtime (AD-026/AD-031), **not** per-rule code:
  - *Adaptive (shadow-block) dynamic params*: give dynamic value inputs a default **shadow** literal
    so a constant shows as an inline editable field and Blockly swaps it for a real connection when a
    rule is dropped in. The encoder reads connected blocks (shadows included), so this round-trips
    naturally. Open decisions before adopting: shadows on **optional** params would erase the
    "absent" (`NO_CONTENT`) case; missing-required readiness would stop flagging empty inputs; and a
    default scalar type isn't in metadata today (`kind` is only dynamic/constant) — likely a
    metadata addition consumed by the projection. Touches behavior, so SPEC-first (§21.2).
  - *Array/Object add/remove slots* — **adopted into M4** (AC-038, §13.13): a rule-agnostic Blockly
    **mutator** (gear/⊕/⊖) in the behavior runtime (AD-031) lets array items / object fields be
    added/removed on the canvas, not only via bidirectional JSON editing.
  - *Per-rule inline layout*: thread an `inputsInline` presentation hint through the metadata/
    projection so expression-like rules (e.g. `expr`) can render side-by-side. Layout only — no
    semantic change; lives in the projection template, not code.
- **runtime metadata-source policy**: let an embedder override the committed metadata snapshot with
  metadata pulled live from a specific (possibly extended) Transon engine build, then **regenerate
  the codec/palette/toolbox** from it. Because the whole surface is `projection(metadata)` (AD-026),
  this is a re-run of the generators, not a code change. Gaps to evaluate: an optional
  `EngineProvider.getEditorMetadata()` pull channel (the Node adapter already does this for tests); a
  `metadata_version` compatibility guard (NFR-040) before trusting injected metadata; an atomic
  rebuild (re-run `G_*`, re-import the canonical JSON under the new catalog, AD-003); and an explicit
  `metadataSource: 'snapshot' | 'host' | 'engine'` policy keeping `'snapshot'` as the deterministic
  default so the parity + codec-regeneration checks and reproducibility stay intact (AD-030). New
  categories/enum-bound params flow through automatically because the toolbox and widgets are
  projected from the metadata, not hardcoded;
- natural-language-to-template assistance; AI-assisted block construction; template linting;
  style-guide enforcement;
- larger include-template manager; multi-template projects;
- visual debugger / step-through execution; runtime value tracing per block; block-level coverage
  using examples;
- advanced performance optimization for large templates; standalone hosted playground; docs-site
  embedded playground; export as image/documentation;
- package as npm library; framework-agnostic web component wrapper; accessibility improvements
  beyond Blockly defaults.

## Out of scope (do not build without a SPEC change first)

Backend accounts/persistence, collaborative/real-time editing, template/plugin marketplaces, a
visual workflow builder unrelated to Transon, multi-step orchestration outside Transon semantics,
scheduled execution, arbitrary Python authoring in the UI, a production execution service,
RBAC/approval workflows, Git-backed storage, public sharing links, or hiding the generated JSON
(`SPEC.md` §4).
